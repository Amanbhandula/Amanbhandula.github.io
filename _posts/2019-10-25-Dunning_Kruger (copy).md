This inclusive nature of Gandhi came from a wide range of experiences he had in his life. His professional careers, languages he used to speak, places he lived in, the knowledge he had of his own religion and acceptance for other religions, his theory of non-violence and satyagraha and his childhood were crucial factors in making him inclusive about everything. 

Our political sense of being one people became part of us during the fight for freedom led by Mahatma Gandhi. The movement for freedom under Gandhi was the first countrywide movement in Indian history and the first event that can be called national because it cut across all divisions of region, religion, caste and class, language and gender, and united us as one people. It was Gandhi, who, through this recognition and exercise of inclusiveness, transformed people of different religions, casts, and classes into a nation.

Gandhiâ€™s concept of inclusiveness was not just political. It had a personal dimension and it was about human dignity. He put it into practice by taking two unusual steps. His first step was to take off the clothes of his class and his privileged upbringing and put on a loincloth and to live half-naked thereafter so that he could lessen the distance between himself and those who lived in conditions of dire poverty and want. The second step he took toward inclusiveness went further, by focusing on untouchability. At a time when it was routinely accepted, he declared it a crime and his fight against it took first place on his agenda, more important than the fight for freedom.
