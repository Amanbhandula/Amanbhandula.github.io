Last year I got this idea of making a health record system for India. It's a centralized system where you can visit any hospital and the doctor will be able to access your health records like your prescriptions, lab reports, allergies, everything. I felt its the most basic problem present in our healthcare industry. 

Truly speaking, I was really surprised to see why there's not a system like this in India. I mean it doesn't need rocket sciece to build a software for this. I searched on the internet, I asked doctors and people in general, but couln't find anything that actually works. 

I then started focusing on the real problem. I spoke with hundreds of doctors, talked to so many people in hospitals and tried to figure out what the real problem is. Why there's not a system like this? Why hospitals are still not digitized? When banks were getting digitized, hospitals could have also been driven to digitize their systems.

One reason is that there are too many players in the industry. There are different small and big hospitals, pharmacies, diagnostic labs, insurance companies and users ofcourse. They must have some incentive to keep the system the way it is right now. But you don't build something like that thinking about incentives of existing players. You just pick a very important problem and look for its solution. That's how big companies are formed, that's how research is done, that's how evrything works.

Second reason is that implementing such a system on a very large scale is very challenging. We have to make it in a way that a small 5 bed hospital as well as a big multi-speciality hospital, everybody can use it.

If we want everyone to be our system, we can't neglect anyone. It's obvious that we can't do it all at once but we've to be inclusive. Our primary goal is not just to make money but to make a system where everyone has control over what they do and they get to use their data in a better productive way. 

I believe its a very fundamental problem we're solving. I personally wanted to build a start-up that uses machine learning, AI, AR and VR to provide better applications to users. 
What we, at Farmako Healthcare are doing should have been done long ago. We're almost starting from zero. We have to grow at a much higher rate so that we can start working on major problems. 

We are running out of time!
