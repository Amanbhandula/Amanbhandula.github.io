Recently, I finished reading "The Idea of Justice" by Amartya Sen. In the book, Sen develops this insight and presents it as an alternative to what he takes to be the dominant approach towards justice. The dominant approach, which Sen calls “transcendental institutionalism,” has two features. First, it defends certain principles of justice as an ideal conception of justice by identifying “social characteristics that cannot
be transcended in terms of justice.” Second, it focuses on the basic institutions of society and is “not directly focused on the actual societies that would ultimately emerge” from those institutions.

By contrast, Sen’s approach begins with social realizations (with what actually happens or could feasible emerge) rather than institutional structures and concentrates on evaluative comparisons over distinct social realizations rather than a unique set of political principles. He calls this the “realization-focused comparison” approach to justice and describes it as focusing on the “advancement or retreat of justice” rather than a perfect social order. Indeed, one way to frame the distinction is in terms of their respective questions. The dominant approach seeks to answer: What is a just society? Sen’s approach answers the question: How might justice be advanced?.

One might think that the two questions are closely related. Rawls thought that ideal theory guides political action and therefore helps answer the second question. Sen thinks that the identification of a perfectly just social arrangement is not only “infeasible” but also “redundant” for issues of nonideal theory. It is infeasible because impartial critical scrutiny generates plausible rivals to any one ideal conception of justice. It is redundant because ideal theory is neither necessary nor sufficient for ranking alternative policies that might advance justice.
