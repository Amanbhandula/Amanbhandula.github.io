I want to decode a research paper- “Unskilled and Unaware of it — How difficulties in recognizing one’s own incompetence lead to inflated self assessments” by Dunning and Kruger. I got interested in this paper after learning about the Dunning-Kruger Effect, which you may have heard of before if the word “imposter syndrome” rings a bell.

The very skills that make you good at your job also make you good at recognizing whether you are good at it. Therefore, when someone is not skilled at their job, they also lack the skill of awareness, which makes them unable to recognize that they are not good.

Less skilled folks definitely overestimate their own skill and ability. Is their misjudgment limited to their own skill or do they also assess their peers’ skills incorrectly? Are incompetent people incapable of assessing their skills?

This is because of what the researchers call false-consensus effect. In the absence of data, the best people assumed that everyone’s performances were similar to their own which is why they underestimated themselves.

Does training less competent people in their core skills actually help their ability to assess their skills? As the former would imply, does increasing your ability to become good at something increase your metacognitive skill as well?

There is a paradox here, that to actually help incompetent people assess their and anyone else’s skills better, we need to train them to make them more competent. Training is the best way to break the cycle. Training will actually help them not develop their own skills but also their overall metacognition.
