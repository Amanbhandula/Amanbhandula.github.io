I'm the founder of Farmako Healthcare. I'm an undergrad at IIT Roorkee. I have been doing Machine Learning and Deep Learning for 4 years. I'm interted in building real world applications using AI and Deep Learning. Currently I'm working in healthcare industry. I'm building something which will change the entire Indian healthcare system first and then it'll change the entire picture of healthcare around the globe. 

My vision is to provide these smart medical tools to those who need it the most. I'd like to tackle more problems like this in future. 

I'd like to study extensively about Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in future. I believe that these techs will bring the next paradign shift in the entire tech industry.

I read books regularly, play guitar in my free time and play squash whenever I get time. I've read very much about Mahatama Gandhi, Steve Jobs, Alan Turing, Bill Gates and many more. I like watching science fiction movies in free time. Currently, I'm reading "The Idea of Justice" by Amartya Sen.
