Hi, I am Aman. I am a fourth-year undergrad student at IIT Roorkee and founder of Farmako Healthcare. We're building India's first centralized health record system. 

I started working on this last year in July'19. I went to a doctor, and I realized that I don't have a structured medical history. I was shocked that how we can miss something so important. Then, I did some research on it and found a lot of underlying problems in the Indian Healthcare Industry. 


I read this in a book once that many successful people from outside of India, visited India to see how people live their daily lives with no lifestyle and tonnes of fundamental problems, which made them realize that there are some severe global issues. It's strange how so many very talented and capable people in India waste their potential in very trivial things like getting settled in life. I mean, you've to do something after looking at these problems that millions of people face every day. It's tough to ignore these things.

I believe that enough people are not working in healthcare, so I decided to do something related to healthcare in the future. I want to build some real-world Machine Learning applications that will complement the role of doctors in the Indian Healthcare system. 

I love reading books, playing squash and cricket. I play guitar in my free time. I love reading about Steve Jobs, Mahatama Gandhi, Alan Turing, Bill Gates, and Swami Vivekanand. I believe that they all had a unique perspective of looking at things. 

I love reading psychology books and blogs. Currently, I'm reading some elementary books in Psychology.
